			<p class="p-cause animated fadeIn">Established in 1961, Amnesty International aims to promote universal human rights through reporting on governments and non-state actors. Though it’s core principle is to focus on prisoners of conscience, including political dissenters, the barbed-wire-wrapped candle of the London-based organization is now a symbol of human rights activists across the globe. Today, Amnesty International mainly deals with women’s, children’s, minorities’, and indigenous rights, ending torture, abolishing the death penalty, rights of refugees, rights of prisoners of conscience, and protection of human dignity.<br><br>

			At Upper Canada College, the Amnesty International Club has three objectives:</p>
			<div>
				<ol class="ol">
					<li>To raise awareness and educate about humanitarian issues</li>
					<li>To promote and encourage action from the community</li>
					<li>To create a space for meaningful discussion about human rights</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p class="p-cause animated fadeIn">
			We believe that to fulfill these objectives, an online publication would be integral to the process. We will regularly publish articles about humanitarian issues on this website. We hope that by reading them, you can gain a better understanding of humanitarian crises and affairs around the world. Moreover, we encourage you to engage in discussions about our articles. By creating an account and signing in, you can comment, and reply to other comments, on our articles. We also encourage submissions and feedback from the public through the “Contact Us” tab. We hope that your voices and opinions can be reflected in our club’s work as well. Finally, if you would like to be a part of Amnesty International UCC, we meet Mondays and Tuesdays at lunch in Room 233 (Mon) and 235 (Tues).<br><br>

			Special thanks to Ms. Bowker, Ms Hui Bon Hoa, the rest of the Amnesty Exec - Shaan, Bassem, Chris, Robbie, and Jeremy, and every club member for their dedicated work as a part of our group!<br><br>

			Also, this website would not be possible without the dedication and hard work or Ibrahim Fadel, who created and maintains this website.<br><br>

			Yours Truly,<br><br>
			Phillip Kong, Editor-in-chief<br><br>
